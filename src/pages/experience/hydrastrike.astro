      HydraStrike is an advanced autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) designed to perform complex underwater missions with high precision and reliability. Developed over a rigorous 40-day period for the U.S. Navy, this 6-foot long unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) incorporates state-of-the-art propulsion technology and innovative bomb-bay actuation mechanisms.

    <p>
      The vehicle features robust sealing systems engineered to withstand extreme underwater pressure and harsh environmental conditions. Extensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses were performed to optimize the hydrodynamic profile, enhancing maneuverability and operational efficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the development process, emphasis was placed on integrating reliable control systems and ensuring structural integrity. The project successfully culminated in open-water testing, where HydraStrike demonstrated exceptional performance, validating its design and operational capabilities in real-world scenarios.
